Rance Rance Human Devolution is a music rhythm game based on Konami’s Dance Dance Revolution but 
rather than playing through levels inspired by popular music, 
you play through levels inspired by songs that have become memes! 
Rance Rance Human Devolution has five levels and is also compatible with Xbox One controllers*.

*Only for PCs that have Windows 10 installed.
